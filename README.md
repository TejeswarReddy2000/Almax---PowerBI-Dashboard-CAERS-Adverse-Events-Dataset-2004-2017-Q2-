## 📖 Project Overview

This project analyzes the **CAERS (Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition Adverse Event Reporting System)** dataset covering **2004–2017 Q2**. The goal is to uncover patterns, demographic insights, and product-related risks associated with **adverse events** reported to the FDA.

Using **PowerBI**, I built an **interactive dashboard** that allows users to explore trends by **age, gender, product type, symptoms, and time series data**.
